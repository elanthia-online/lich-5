# Provides a unified interface for interacting with Player System Manager (PSM) skills
# in GemStone IV, such as Combat Maneuvers, Shield Specializations, Feats, Warcries,
# Weapon Techniques, and Armor Specializations.
#
# This module acts as a central registry and utility for:
# - Normalizing skill names for lookup.
# - Querying and validating available PSM skills by type.
# - Determining stamina costs and eligibility for use.
# - Evaluating the character's ability to perform forced roundtime actions.
# - Detecting common PSM failure responses using pattern matching.
#
# Each PSM category (e.g., `CMan`, `Shield`, `Feat`) is defined in its own file and loaded as a submodule.
#
# @example Check if a skill can be used with current stamina
#   PSMS.assess("bullrush", "CMan", true)
#
# @example Normalize a skill name for consistent lookup
#   PSMS.name_normal("Smash")
