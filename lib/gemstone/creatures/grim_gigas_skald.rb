The robes he wears are of dusky golden boarskin and appear ceremonial, having been stitched with hundreds of beads made from semiprecious gems.  A grim gigas skald wears a tremendous drinking horn at {pronoun} belt.",

      "Preceded by a mournful dirge, a grim gigas skald stalks in, his song accompanied by the clacking of the crude jeweled beads adorning the ceremonial garb that he wears.",

    general_advice: "* Options like [[Hamstring]] or [[Brawling|unarmed combat]] essentially get around [[DS]], which is useful since skalds have pretty high DS even when forced into offensive stance and their unconventional lyre weapon can't be removed by typical tactics like [[Disarm Weapon]] or [[Vibration Chant (1002)]].\n* [[Standard_maneuver_roll|SMR]]-based offense like [[Condemn (309)]], [[Earthen Fury (917)]], and [[Spike Thorn (616)]] works well against skalds.",
    clerics: "* Since the strength of each damaging round of Condemn is based only on the initial roll, it can often be worthwhile to cast Condemn again before the first cast has finished if that first cast had a low enough endroll. This is especially true if the first cast isn't doing enough damage to keep them stunned, which is crucial since skalds' SMR attack can be lethal and their TD is sufficiently high that [[Soul Ward (319)]] isn't always reliable defense.",
    rangers: "* Spike Thorn is an excellent option, but if the ranger is relatively untrained to make use of it because he has few ranks of [[Ranger Base]] and/or [[Spiritual Lore, Summoning|Summoning]] lore, or simply if mana needs to be conserved, then [[Animal Companion (630)|animal companions]] can also do significant damage to or even kill skalds affected by [[Wild Entropy (603)]] or [[Moonbeam (611)]].",
