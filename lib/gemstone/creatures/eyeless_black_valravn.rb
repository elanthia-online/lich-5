    general_advice: "* Broadly speaking, valravns are a \"glass cannon\" type of creature. Their \"glass\" is durable in the sense of high [[DS]] and [[TD]], but when attacks get past those thresholds--or attacks that bypass them, like [[Standard maneuver roll|SMR]]-based attacks or [[Brawling|unarmed combat]]--they're likely to hit these unarmored creatures hard and they have a fairly small amount of health.\n* Valravns are primarily magical creatures and are fairly vulnerable to maneuver-based spells and attacks like [[Earthen Fury (917)]], [[Hamstring]], [[Spike Thorn (616)]], [[Twin Hammerfists]], and more. This is offset somewhat by their high level, however.",
    voln: "* [[Symbol of Diminishment]] can make valravns far more manageable. However, their high level imposes a penalty against the [[standard success resolution system]] that [[Order of Voln|Voln]] symbols use, so it might take multiple tries. High [[Influence]] can counteract level disadvantage somewhat.",
    clerics: "* Valravns have high TD, but [[Prayer of Holding (301)]] only needs a 101 endroll to set up for one or two strong casts of [[Condemn (309)]] afterward.",
    paladins: "* High [[Spiritual Lore, Religion|Religion]] lore is doubly helpful against valravns, as [[Zealot (1617)]] can push paladins' [[attack strength|AS]] over the top and [[Divine Incarnation (1650)]] Smite, given enough lore to reliably hit twice, frequently destroys valravns while divine energy lasts.\n* Either [[Aura of the Arkati (1614)]] or [[Repentance (1615)]] as the infused spell in a paladin's [[Holy Weapon (1625)|bonded weapon]] works well, since in either case they only need a 101 endroll to accomplish their main goals of, respectively, a debuff or forcing a valravn to kneel.",
    rangers: "* [[Moonbeam (611)]] is a near universal solution in the [[Hinterwilds]] and valravns are no exception.",

An eyeless black valravn turns to look at you, the empty pits where its eyes should be swelling into lightless pools that hungrily drink the surrounding light.
Mana cascades across your x'aganjira ataniki, causing the fabric to shiver against your skin as it draws the scattered power into it and transforms it into mana.  [You gain 2 mana!]
  CS: +505 - TD: +441 + CvA: +5 + d98: +2 - -5 == +76
  Warded off!
  You shut your eyes, resisting the force of the valravn's gaze.
