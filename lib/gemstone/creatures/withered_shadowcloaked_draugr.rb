    description: "Utterly immense, the draugr's humanoid shape is comprised wholly of inky shadows that drip and pool at its intangible feet.  Cruel eyes of frigid light glare from a face of sharp lines and malevolent angles.  The shade's arms are lightless and devoid of all but the most rudimentary features, but are massively thick and traced with intricate lines of blazing blue radiance.",
    general_advice: "* Taking out a draugr's greatsword and leaving them swinging a closed fist is as close to taking out the draugr as can be short of actually killing it, so [[Disarm Weapon]], [[Vibration Chant (1002)]], or even [[Limb Disruption (708)]] work great here. DoT spells like [[Condemn (309)]] and [[Earthen Fury (917)]] are liable to also sever an arm by sheer probability given enough rounds of going off.\n* In lieu of killing a draugr or getting rid of its weapon, another strong option is taking out its legs or inflicting [[Rooted]] since draugrs rely heavily on high [[attack strength|AS]] or maneuvers to be effective. [[Hamstring]] (despite [[Major Bleed]] not affecting [[undead]]), [[Cripple]], [[Pin Down]], and other options can do the trick.\n* In lieu of any of the above, draugrs are also [[square]] enemies in light armor, so low [[TD]] and low [[CvA]] leaves them pretty vulnerable to most [[CS]]-based attacks despite their high level."
