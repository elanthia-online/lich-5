    general_advice: "* Oozes are essentially noncorporeal, uncrittable, unstunnable damage sponges that often divide themselves into oozelings upon getting hit, where each oozeling has a fraction of the original ooze's health but otherwise has similar combat abilities and stats on all fronts. If left unchecked long enough, the oozelings' health will grow. Since oozes reduce their own health by splitting and since they split when they're attacked, using even weak AoE attacks can clear rooms more quickly than using powerful single-target attacks. [[Clash]], [[Cyclone]], [[Divine Incarnation (1650)]] Onslaught, [[Divine Wrath (335)]], [[Judgment (1630)]], [[Nature's Fury (635)]], [[Pulverize]], [[Song of Sonic Disruption (1030)]], [[Volley]] (with a [[short bow]] or [[hand crossbow]] only to keep [[roundtime|RT]] manageable), [[Whirling Blade]], and [[Whirlwind]] are all good. In particular, Divine Wrath, Song of Sonic Disruption, and Volley stand out due to respectively multiple rounds of damage, low [[mana]] cost (upon renewal), and low [[stamina]] cost mixed with multiple rounds of damage. All three of those options can lead to rooms going from one ooze to ten in no time, then down to zero also in no time, as oozes divide constantly.\n* If absorbed by an ooze, an adventurer can attack its organ until it spits them out.\n** Military pick worked, dagger & spear did not.\n* Culling bounties for oozes go quickly since oozelings count."
