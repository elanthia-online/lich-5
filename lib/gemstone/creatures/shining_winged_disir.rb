    description: "Clad from head to toe in armor of shining gold, the disir takes the form of a powerfully built woman with ageless features and eyes like pools of sunlit sky.  On her head, nestled atop curls of shimmering hair, is a winged helm whose visor dips low over her face, lending a grim cast to her features.  The disir's skin is faintly luminous, with hints of rainbowed color pulsing beneath it.",

    bards: "* [[Vibration Chant (1002)]] can eliminate their \"[[spear]]s\" (which hit like [[lance]]s). Disirs then switch to a magical, non-physical shield which can't be blown up, but many will find that preferable to letting them swing lances with 650 AS.",
    clerics: "* Disirs behave somewhat unpredictably under the effects of [[Prayer of Holding (301)]], as sometimes it'll keep them bound while other times they'll shake it off immediately and counterattack in a single combat round. The fact that it even sometimes holds them makes it viable as a setup leading into [[Condemn (309)]], though, as it just means binding them repeatedly until it sticks.",
    paladins: "* Disirs move fairly quickly in combat, so, in this case, casting [[Aura of the Arkati (1614)]] the hard way and then attacking with a beseeched [[Repentance (1615)]] is far more reliable than the other way around. Opening with Repentance might allow the disir to get up by the time the paladin's out of cast RT and on to her physical attack, but opening with the Aura of the Arkati debuff will leave that lasting long enough to carry through to the followup.",
    rangers: "* [[Moonbeam (611)]] is a near universal solution in the [[Hinterwilds]] and disirs are no exception. However, they can occasionally get out of even that, so tread carefully. A followup [[Spike Thorn (616)]] against a bound disir will often miss the kill even with heavy training in [[Ranger Base]] and [[Spiritual Lore, Summoning|Summoning lore]], which is more than most Hinterwilds creatures can say, but repeated casts will still win the day.",
