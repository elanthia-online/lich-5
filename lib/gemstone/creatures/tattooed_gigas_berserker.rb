    description: "A tattooed gigas berserker is a hulking brute of a gigas, standing more than four times the height of a man and with the immense muscle mass to match.  His vast biceps are ringed with intricate tattoos in auroral colors: glacial blues and flashfire greens that are bright enough to have been stolen from cut jewels.  The rest of him is unlovely, from his matted beard to the look of murder in his bulging eyes.",
