The bloodspeaker wears heavy robes of red velvet that do little to conceal the broken-puppet jangle of {pronoun} misshapen body beneath them.  {pronoun} tongue is bisected and lolls forth from a mouth that looks like a wet gash in {pronoun} obscene face.",

    general_advice: "* Warding casters will have more success against this creature with a high [[TD]] if they cast dispelling magic upon it first.\n* [[Standard_maneuver_roll|SMR]]-based attacks like [[Condemn (309)]], [[Earthen Fury (917)]], and [[Spike Thorn (616)]] frequently tear through bloodspeakers. [[Animal Companion (630)|Animal companions]] can also do significant damage.\n* [[Silenced|Silencing]] tactics like [[Cutthroat]] and [[Sucker Punch]], or the similar [[Corrupt Essence (703)]], will halt their threatening [[Wither (1115)]] spell. ([[Silence (210)]] itself is unlikely to hit barring an unusual build heavily focused on [[Major Spiritual]] ranks.)",
