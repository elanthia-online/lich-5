A large, craggy maw in the middle of the elemental's chest appears to be the creature's mouth, and the earth elemental's huge feet and giant-sized fists look like they would pulverize flesh without much effort at all.\n</pre>\nGreater earth elementals have DFRedux which will reduce the damage factors of weapons, including bolt spells, by 30% for AS-based attacks. This is in addition to their natural full plate equivalent armor."
