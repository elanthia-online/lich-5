    general_advice: "* As primarily casting creatures, mutants are fairly vulnerable to [[Standard_maneuver_roll|SMR]]-based spells and attacks like [[Condemn (309)]], [[Earthen Fury (917)]], [[Hamstring]], [[Spike Thorn (616)]], [[Twin Hammerfists]], and so on. This is offset somewhat by their high level, though.\n* Mutants have exceptionally high CS--over 520--that leaves their [[Thought Lash (1210)]], [[Bind (214)]], and [[Vertigo (1219)]] spells nearly guaranteed to hit against every profession and leave characters stunned or disabled. Keep them from casting by any means including [[Sweep]], [[Feint]], [[Corrupt Essence (703)]], [[Moonbeam (611)]], Condemn, Earthen Fury, or other options that keep them stalled out, unable to cast, or repeatedly stunned.\n* Mutants have [[Brace (1214)]], which can disarm against many forms of physical attacks. However, many combat maneuvers and SMR-based weapon techniques bypass this, as do ranged attacks and [[Brawling|unarmed combat]]. Brace can also be removed via dispelling magic such as [[Spirit Dispel (119)]], [[Spiritual Abolition (230)]], [[Elemental Dispel (417)]], [[Mental Dispel (1218)]], and [[Song of Unravelling (1013)]] or other similar effects like [[Spell Cleave]].",
    voln: "* [[Symbol of Transcendence]] can sometimes salvage a bad situation, either preemptively or used with its emergency cooldown. High CS aside, mutants are still mostly casting disablers or attacking with one of the weaker weapon bases, the [[cudgel]], so it's possible to survive even ten rounds of stun with enough luck.\n* [[Symbol of Restoration]] can be used while [[Immobilized]] by Bind.",
    bards: "* [[Vibration Chant (1002)]] can destroy their weapons and has at least a chance to kill outright.\n* Be ready to shout [[Troubadour's Rally (1040)]] at a moment's notice to get away safely after being hit by any of a mutant's dangerous spells.",
    clerics: "* The INFUSE SPIRIT option of [[Soul Ward (319)]] can sometimes delay mutants long enough to keep a cleric alive through lengthy stun.",
    empaths: "* The REGENERATE option of [[Regeneration (1150)]] can sometimes keep an empath healed and padded to survive lengthy stun a limited number of times per day, depending on [[Mental Lore, Transformation|Transformation]] lore.",
    paladins: "* [[Divine Incarnation (1650)]] Smite with enough [[Spiritual Lore, Religion|Religion]] lore to reliably hit twice will usually do substantial damage to mutants, if not outright kill them, while divine energy lasts.\n* Be ready to beseech [[Divine Intervention (1635)]] at a moment's notice to get away safely after being hit by any of a mutant's dangerous spells.",
    rangers: "* With enough [[Ranger Base]] ranks, Moonbeam is a nearly universal solution in the Hinterwilds and mutants are no exception."
