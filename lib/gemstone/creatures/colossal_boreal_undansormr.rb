    general_advice: "* Undansormrs have great amounts of health, pretty high [[DS]], exceptional [[TD]], decent [[Standard maneuver roll|maneuver]] defense by virtue of their high level if nothing else, immunity to being knocked prone, and no limbs to get rid of to make them less effective. However, [[Brawling|unarmed combat]] can kill undansormrs reasonably effectively with focused mstrikes, [[Fury]], or stray tiered-up shots to the head (one of the only body parts this worm-like creature does have). Even a [[pure]] (with trained Brawling and [[Combat Maneuvers]]) can make unarmed combat work against them with minor setup of stunning the undansormr first to increase MM and more than overcome the UAF vs. UDF gap."
